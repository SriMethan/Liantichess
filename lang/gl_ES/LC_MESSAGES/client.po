"\"To me, how we've got here today is owing to Stockfish in a BIG way. They "

"\"Para min, o feito de estar hoxe aquí debémosllo nunha GRANDE parte a "

msgstr ""
"Máis tarde, desenvolvedores achegados ao proxecto Lichess deron en estender "

"traballando nese fork, e máis tarde deu varios pasos máis en termos de "
