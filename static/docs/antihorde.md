# Antihorde

A hybrid of two variants Antichess and Horde gives Antihorde. The ultimate goal of the game is to loose all your pieces like in antichess, but like in horde chess the starting position is different where white has 36 pawns. Also note that the pawn on the first rank can move two steps on the first move.
