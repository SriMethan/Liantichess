# ![AntiPlacement](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/blob/master/static/icons/placement.svg) AntiPlacement Chess (Bronstein chess, Pre-Chess, Shuffle-Chess)

Pal Benko credited the idea of “Pre-Chess” or “Shuffle-Chess” to David Bronstein.

Different than the “AntiPlacementChess” described on the Chess Variants site, this variant is simply as antichess and modification where players take turns placing their back rank pieces. Castling only works when the king and the corresponding rook are in their normal position.
